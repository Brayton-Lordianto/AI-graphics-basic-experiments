# AI-graphics-basic-experiments

This repository contains some basic experiments with AI and graphics. You can find questions and answers in the juptyer notebooks.

<!-- basic pytorch rendering, linked to the file -->
# [Basic Pytorch Rendering](basic_pytorch_rendering.ipynb)

Simple rendering of a 3D meshes using Pytorch, including rendering a sphere and a cube. Basic transforms and tenssor operations are used.

# [Bundle Adjustment](bundle_adjustment.ipynb)

Bundle adjustment is a technique in the field of computer vision used to improve the accuracy of structure from motion. It is used to refine the parameters of a 3D scene and the pose of the camera. In this notebook, we implement a simple bundle adjustment algorithm using Pytorch.

# [Mesh deformation](mesh_deformation_using_machine_learning.ipynb)

Using machine learning to deform a sphere into a point cloud after several iterations to provide smooth deformation.
